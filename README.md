# BurpOps

My personal collection of specialized Burp Suite extensions developed during real-world security engagements to solve edge cases and streamline security testing workflows.

## Extensions
[TokenLeech.py](https://github.com/falasi/BurpOps/blob/main/TokenLeech.py) - A Burp Suite extension that dynamically injects and refreshes HTTP headers by reading values from files via command outputs. Perfect for handling ephemeral credentials and session tokens during security testing.

## Development
These extensions are developed in Jython for compatibility with Burp Suite's extension framework.
